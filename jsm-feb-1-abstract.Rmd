### Data structures and functions for consistent exploration of missing data


Missing values are ubiquitous in data and need to be explored and handled in the initial stages of analysis. Superficial treatment of missing values can lead to biased results, however the exploration of missing values can be a difficult and computationally inefficient process. As a typical example, ggplot2 throws a warning about missing values and omits them from plotting [@wickham2009ggplot2]. There is a need for tools that support the exploratory data analysis of missing data within the framework of tidy data [@wickham2014]. Our proposed extension to tidy data structure incorporates specific treament of missings that ensures they can be handled effectively for summarization, plotting, and imputation. This paper describes a package, `naniar`, that utilizes our proposed data structure to explore missing data dependencies with minimal deviation from the common workflows of ggplot and tidy data.
