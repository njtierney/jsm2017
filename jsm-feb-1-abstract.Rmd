### Data structures and functions for consistent exploration of missing data

Missing values are ubiquitous in data and need to be carefully explored and
handled in the initial stages of analysis to avoid bias. However, exploring why
and how values are missing is typically an inefficient process. For example,
visualising data with missing values in ggplot2 results in omission of missing
values with a warning, and base R silently omits missing values (Wickham,
2016). Additionally, imputed missing data are not typically distinguished in
visualisation and data summaries. Tidy data structures described in Wickham
(2014) provide an efficient, easy and consistent approach to performing data
manipulation and wrangling, where each row is an observation and each column
is a variable. There are currently no guidelines for representing missing
data structures in a tidy format, nor simple approaches to visualising missing
values. This paper describes an R package, naniar, for exploring missing values
in data with minimal deviation from the common workflows of ggplot and tidy
data. Naniar builds data structures and functions that ensure missing values are
handled effectively for plotting and summarising data with missing values, and
examining the effects of imputation.
