### Data structures and functions for consistent exploration of missing data

Missing values are ubiquitous in data and need to be carefully explored and
handled in the initial stages of analysis to avoid bias. However, exploring
why and how values are missing is typically an inefficient process. For
example, visualisation of data with missing values in ggplot2 typically
results in a warning and missing values being omitted (Wickham, 2016). Additionally, multiply imputated values are not typically given in data
structures easy to visualise and summarise along with original data. Tidy data
structures as described in Wickham (2014) state that each row is an observation
and each column is a variable. These principles provide an efficient, easy
and consistent approach to perform data manipulation and wrangling. There are
currently no guidelines for representing missing data structures in a tidy
format, or simple approaches to visualise missing values. This paper describes
an R package, `naniar`, for exploring missing values in data with minimal
deviation from the common workflows of ggplot and tidy data. Our package builds
data structures and functions that ensure missings are handled effectively for
plotting, summarising, and examining imputations.
